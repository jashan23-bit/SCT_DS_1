TASK 01 _ Create a bar chart or histogram to visualize the distribution of a categorical or continuous variable, such as the distribution of ages or genders in a population.  Sample Dataset  Skull Craft Technology




🌍 Top 10 Most Populous Countries (2020) - Data Visualization Project
📌 Project Overview
This project is part of my internship at SkillCraft Technology, where I was tasked with creating meaningful visualizations to explore population data using Python. The goal was to gain hands-on experience with real-world datasets, practice data visualization techniques, and present the insights clearly.

Using population data from the World Bank (2020), I created:

📊 A bar chart to visually compare the population of the top 10 most populous countries

📈 A histogram to observe how the population is distributed

🧰 Tools & Technologies Used
Python 🐍

Pandas: for data handling

Seaborn & Matplotlib: for visualization

Spyder IDE via Anaconda Navigator: as my development environment

📈 Key Learnings
Cleaned and structured real-world data for visualization

Explored the strengths and differences between histograms and bar plots

Practiced using color palettes, data labels, and layout adjustments for clarity

Improved GitHub workflow by uploading scripts, images, and writing proper documentation

🎯 Future Enhancements
Make the plots interactive using Plotly

Add gender and age group comparisons

Include population trends over multiple years
